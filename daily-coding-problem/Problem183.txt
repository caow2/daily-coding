This problem was asked by Twitch.
Describe what happens when you type a URL into your browser and press Enter.

When you type a URL into your browser and press Enter (for example -> www.twitch.tv)
you are trying to send some sort of request.

In order to send the request, you must first obtain the correct IP address for your URL.
This is done by querying a DNS server for IP Address of the server that corresponds to the URL.

Typically, you then establish a TCP connection using a 3 way handshake with the server.
This involves trying to establish a connection, getting acknowledgement back from the server,
and then finally sending your original request.

On the server side, there may be a few things happening.
For example, there may be a load balancer distributing workload across different servers.
Once your request is processed, the data is sent back to you through the TCP connection
and your browser renders the content.
